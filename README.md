# Auto-mpg-Analysis


## Project Overview
This project involves clustering vintage cars using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and find distinct vehicle groups, helping SecondLife, a used car dealership, to target different customer segments effectively.

## Business Context
SecondLife is focusing on vintage cars and has collected data over the years. The company aims to leverage this data to identify distinct groups of vintage cars for more efficient marketing and operational strategies.

## Objective
- Explore the vintage car dataset.
- Use PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
- Cluster vehicles into groups and provide insights for targeting different audiences.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following 8 variables:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
- `cyl`: Number of cylinders
- `disp`: Engine displacement (in cubic inches)
- `hp`: Horsepower
- `wt`: Vehicle weight (in pounds)
- `acc`: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (seconds)
- `yr`: Model year (year of manufacture)
- `car name`: Car model name

## Techniques Used
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA and t-SNE.
- **Clustering**: Identify car groups based on vehicle attributes.
